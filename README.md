# Disaster Management System Design
a place for everyone to contribute ideas and design the Disaster Management System

# Why?

Currently, we are encountering numerous disasters worldwide on an annual basis, and they are expected to become more frequent in the future. The issue lies in the fact that many countries, such as Vietnam, lack a comprehensive solution for managing all aspects of disasters. For this reason, I have created this repository with the aim of developing a complete disaster management solution. This is a substantial project, and I believe that its completion will depend on contributions from a wide range of individuals.

# Objectives:

## 1. Create a complete solution to manage everything related to disaster ( prevention, risk reduction, recovery, .... )

# Projects

## 1. Ideas Sharing:

Right now, we don't have specialized software to manage everyone's ideas, so we will use this Discord: https://discord.gg/CQeXuaw7 to share and discuss our ideas.

## 2. Disaster Recovery Guideline:

This app will enable collaboration between the government and citizens to assist people in disaster areas.
