# Disaster Management System Design
a place for everyone to contribute ideas and design the Disaster Management System

# Why?

Currently, we are encountering numerous disasters worldwide on an annual basis, and they are expected to become more frequent in the future. The issue lies in the fact that many countries, such as Vietnam, lack a comprehensive solution for managing all aspects of disasters. For this reason, I have created this repository with the aim of developing a complete disaster management solution. This is a substantial project, and I believe that its completion will depend on contributions from a wide range of individuals.
